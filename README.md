# Unblind 

The idea of unblind is to have a full text editor in the terminal with every keyboard shortcut of non-terminal editors. The editor is very portable as it is written in C and compiles to a single file.
Unblind uses common keybinds so you don't have to waste your time looking up every single action you need to use.
